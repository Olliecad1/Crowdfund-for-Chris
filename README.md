# Fundraiser Story

Since June 2015, [Chris Ellis](https://twitter.com/MrChrisEllis) has been suffering from chronic:
+ Headaches
+ [Hyperacusis](http://www.ucsfhealth.org/conditions/hyperacusis/)
+ [Tinnitus](http://www.ucsfhealth.org/conditions/tinnitus/)
+ [Insomnia](http://www.ucsfhealth.org/conditions/insomnia/)

In order to function normally and sleep through the night, he needs to take sleeping pills and strong sedatives. Though he has sought many doctors and undergone various tests (MRI, CT etc.), the root cause of his illness is still unknown. 
> Note: His most recent MRI scans have been uploaded to Dropbox. 
> If any neuroradiologists specializing in the head/skull would be willing to take a look at them, please contact for access. 
> Qualified professionals only, please.

Despite his illness, he has continued to work on vairous open-source projects within the Bitcoin community, including building Raspberry Pi full nodes to raise money for the peer-to-peer tipping app [ProTip](http://protip.is/), which he co-created with developer [Leo Campbell](https://github.com/Leo-ajc). Paying himself only $3 per hour, he has [already completed one sucessful crowdfund](https://www.startjoin.com/ProTip) and vows to build a total of 500 within the coming year.

**But he needs our help.** The combined cost of the medications he currently takes and specialist doctors he needs to visit is too much for him to pay for on his own. In order to express our gratitude for his friendship and important contributions, we are organizing a crowdfund to support his treatment and hope for a cure.

Hello, my name is Oliver Morris. I am learning Python, HTML & CSS programming. I've known Chris through the World Crypto Network for about a month. I decided to organize this crowdfund because he teaches us all this good knowledge, through the #FullNode projet and about cryptography. He's a very good and clever person, so please donate to help our friend – he will appreciate it.
